My home-brewed IITC plugin(s).

## group-drawn-items-by-color
Usage:
Toolbox -> DrawTools Enhancement Opt
- Add Avaliable Items To Storage: Read all features displaying and store them to the storage. New items will directly OVERWRITE the existing items which share the same color.
- Show By Color / Show All: Read from storage and display
- Hide By Color / Hide All: Remove from map but not from storage
- Remove From Storage By Color / Remove All Stored Items: Remove from storage but not from map

It is recommended to backup all your drawn items via DrawTools beforehand in order to prevent any data loss due to potential bugs XD.
